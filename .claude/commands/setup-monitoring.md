Interview the user to gather comprehensive details about their media monitoring setup:

1. **Subject of Monitoring**: Who or what is being monitored? (e.g., a person, company, organization, topic, industry, etc.)

2. **Purpose of Monitoring**: Why are they collecting these articles? (e.g., reputation management, competitive intelligence, research, brand tracking, industry analysis)

3. **Key Topics/Themes**: What specific topics, keywords, or themes are most relevant to this monitoring?

4. **Publications of Interest**: Are there specific publications they want to prioritize or track?

5. **Monitoring Scope**: What's the geographic scope (local, national, international)? Time period? Language preferences?

6. **Relevance Criteria**: What makes an article relevant for inclusion? What should be excluded?

7. **Use Cases**: How will they use this data? (e.g., reports, analysis, alerts, archive)

After gathering this information, **UPDATE THE CLAUDE.md FILE** in the repository root with this context. Specifically:

- Update the "Monitoring Subject Context" section with the subject details
- Add any additional context that will help future Claude sessions understand the monitoring purpose
- Include specifics about relevance criteria and key topics
- Document any special handling requirements

Confirm with the user that the CLAUDE.md has been updated correctly and that you understand the monitoring context for future article fetching and analysis tasks.
